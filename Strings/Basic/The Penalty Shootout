Problem Statement:
Given a string S contains 0's, 1's, and 2's, the task is to find the number of goals on the penalty.
 '1' stands for "goal".
 '0' stands for "no goal".
 '2' stands for a foul which gives a penalty.
 
 Solution:
 public int penaltyScore(String S)
    {
        int counter=0;
        for(int i=1;i<S.length();++i)
        {
            if(S.charAt(i)=='1' && S.charAt(i-1)=='2')
                ++counter;
        }
        return counter;
    }
