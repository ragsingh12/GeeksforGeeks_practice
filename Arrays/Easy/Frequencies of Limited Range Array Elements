Problem Statement:
Given an array A[] of N positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to P where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array.
Your task is to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to N.
Note: The elements greater than N in the array can be ignored for counting and please read your task section of the problem carefully to understand how to output the array.

Solution:
public static void frequencyCount(int arr[], int N, int P)
    {
        int length=0;
        if(P>N)
            length=P;
        else
            length=N;
        int[] count=new int[length+1];
        Arrays.fill(count,0);
        for(int i=0;i<N;++i)
            ++count[arr[i]];
        for(int j=1;j<=N;++j)
            arr[j-1]=count[j];
    }
