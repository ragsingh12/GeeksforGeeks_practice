Problem Statement:
Given two sorted arrays of distinct elements. There is only 1 difference between the arrays.
First array has one element extra added in between. Find the index of the extra element.

Solution:
public int findExtra(int a[], int b[], int n)
    {
        int l=1,r=n-2;
        if(a[n-1]!=b[n-2])
            return n-1;
        else
        {
            while(l<=r)
            {
                int mid=l+(r-l)/2;
                if(a[mid]==b[mid])
                    l=mid+1;
                else if(a[mid]!=b[mid] && a[mid-1]==b[mid-1])
                    return mid;
                else
                    r=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
