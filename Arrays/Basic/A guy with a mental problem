Problem Statement:
A guy has to reach his home and does not want to be late. He takes train to reach home. He has a mental illness, so he always switches train at every station.
For eg: If he starts with train A then at station 2 he will switch his train to train B and so on. 
Similarly, if he starts with train B then he will switch to train A at station 2 and so on. 
Please help him to find the minimum total time he would take to reach his home.

Solution:
 public long minTime(long a[], long b[], long n)
    {
        long sum1=0,sum2=0;
        int size=(int)n;
        for(int i=0;i<size;++i)
        {
            if(i%2==0)
                sum1+=a[i];
            else
                sum1+=b[i];
        }
        for(int j=0;j<size;++j)
        {
           if(j%2==0)
                sum2+=b[j];
           else
                sum2+=a[j]; 
        }
        if(sum1<sum2)
            return sum1;
        else
             return sum2;
    }
