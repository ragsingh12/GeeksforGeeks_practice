Problem Statement:
Given an array arr[] of size N representing the size of candles which reduce by 1 unit each day. 
The room is illuminated using the given N candles. Find the maximum number of days the room is without darkness.

Solution:
long maxDays(long arr[], int n)
    {
        long max_Size=-100000;
        for(int i=0;i<n;++i)
            if(arr[i]>max_Size)
                max_Size=arr[i];
        return max_Size;
    }
