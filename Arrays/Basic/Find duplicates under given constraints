Problem Statement:
Given a sorted array A[] having 10 elements which contain 6 different numbers in which only 1 number is repeated five times.
Your task is to find the duplicate number using two comparisons only.

Solution:
public int findDuplicate(int A[])
    {
        int result=0;
        if((A[3]==A[4]) || (A[4]==A[5]))
            result=A[4];
        else
            result=A[5];
        return result;
    }
