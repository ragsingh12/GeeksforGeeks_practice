Problem Statement:
Given an array Arr of N positive integers and a number K where K is used as a threshold value to divide each element of the array into sum of different numbers.
Find the sum of count of the numbers in which array elements are divided.

Solution:
int totalCount(int[] arr, int n, int k)
    {
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;++i)
        {
            if(arr[i]%k==0)
                sum=sum+(arr[i]/k);
            else
                sum=sum+((arr[i]/k)+1);
        }
        return sum;
    }
