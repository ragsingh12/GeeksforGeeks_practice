Problem Statement:
There is a hacker named "Vijay" who has developed a method to check whether an id at some social networking site is fake or real using its username.
His method includes: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then the user is a male, otherwise a female.
You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help Vijay to determine the gender of this user by his method. Ignore the vowels.
Note: The input only contains lowercase English alphabets.

Solution:
public String solve(String a)
    {
        HashSet<Character> array=new HashSet<Character>();
        for(int i=0;i<a.length();++i)
        {
            if(a.charAt(i)!='a' && a.charAt(i)!='e' && a.charAt(i)!='i' &&
            a.charAt(i)!='o' && a.charAt(i)!='u')
            {
                if(!array.contains(a.charAt(i)))
                    array.add(a.charAt(i));
            }
        }
        if((array.size()&1)==0)
            return "SHE!";
        else
            return "HE!";
    }
