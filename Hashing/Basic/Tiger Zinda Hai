Problem Statement:
Rohan is downloading the movie Tiger Zinda Hai using a torrent website, but he is new to torrent, 
so he doesn't know the difference between a fake download button and a real download button; therefore, he keeps pressing every button in excitement.
Now he has clicked N  buttons, and many tabs are opened, if an opened tab is clicked again then it closes it. Your task is to tell how many tabs are open at the end.

Solution:
public static int count_tabs(String[] arr,int n)
    {
        int counter=0;
        HashSet<String> str=new HashSet<String>();
        for(int i=0;i<n;++i)
        {
            if(arr[i].equals("END"))
            {
                str.clear();
                counter=0;
            }
            else
            {
                if(!str.contains(arr[i]))
                {
                    str.add(arr[i]);
                    ++counter;
                }
                else
                {
                    str.remove(arr[i]);
                    --counter;
                }
            }
        }
        return counter;
    }
