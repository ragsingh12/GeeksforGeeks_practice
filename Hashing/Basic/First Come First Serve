Problem Statement:
CodeMart is a shopping platform and it is distributing gift vouchers to its esteemed users. 
The voucher can be redeemed by providing a fixed amount of shopping credits to the platform. 
One credit is sent by a user to the platform by doing one occurance in CodeMart.
Since there is a huge rush of people you are required to manage the users on the basis of first come first serve. 
The user which came first and has exactly k occurrences at last is given the voucher first. 
You are given an array arr[ ] with the id's of N users in chronological order of their occurances . 
You are required to print the id of the user which will be given the voucher first. If no such user meets the condition print "-1".

Solution:
static int firstElement(int arr[], int n, int k)
    { 
        HashMap<Integer,Integer> array=new HashMap<Integer,Integer>();
        for(int i=0;i<n;++i)
        {
            if(!array.containsKey(arr[i]))
                array.put(arr[i],1);
            else
                array.put(arr[i],array.get(arr[i])+1);
        }
        for(int i=0;i<n;++i)
        {
            if(array.get(arr[i])==k)
                return arr[i];
        }
        return -1;
    }
