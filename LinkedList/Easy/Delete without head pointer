Problem Statement:
You are given a pointer/ reference to the node which is to be deleted from the linked list of N nodes.
The task is to delete the node. Pointer/ reference to head node is not given. 
Note: No head reference is given to you. It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the linked list.

Solution:
void deleteNode(Node del)
    {
        Node temp=del.next;
        del.data=temp.data;
        del.next=temp.next;
        temp=null;
    }
