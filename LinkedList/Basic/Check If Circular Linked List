Problem Statement:
Given head, the head of a singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not. 
A linked list is called circular if it not NULL terminated and all nodes are connected in the form of a cycle. 
An empty linked list is considered as circular.

Solution:
boolean isCircular(Node head)
    {
	    Node temp=head;
	    while(temp.next!=head)
	    {
	        if(temp.next==null)
	            return false;
	        temp=temp.next;
	    }
	    return true;
    }
