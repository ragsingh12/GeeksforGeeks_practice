Problem Statement:
Mr. Geek is a greedy seller. He has a stock of N laptops which comprises of both useful and useless laptops. 
Now, he wants to organize a sale to clear his stock of useless laptops. 
The prices of N laptops are Ai each consisting of positive and negative integers (-ve denoting useless laptops). In a day, he can sell atmost M laptops. 
Mr. Geek being a greedy seller want to earn maximum profit out of this sale. So, help him maximizing his profit by selling useless laptops.

Solution:
public static long maxProfit(int a[], int n, int m) 
    {
        long sum=0;
        Arrays.sort(a);
        if(m>n)
        {
           for(int i=0;i<n;++i)
            {
                if(a[i]<0)
                    sum+=a[i];
            } 
        }
        else
        {
            for(int i=0;i<m;++i)
            {
                if(a[i]<0)
                    sum+=a[i];
            }
        }
        sum=Math.abs(sum);
        return sum;
    }
