Problem Statement:
Two arrays of size N are called identical arrays if they contain the same elements. The order of elements in both arrays could be different; however, 
both the arrays must contain same elements. You are given two arrays of size N.
You need to determine if the arrays are identical or not.

Solution:
public static int check (int arr[], int[] brr, int n)
    {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        Arrays.sort(brr);
        for(int i=0;i<n;++i)
        {
            if(arr[i]!=brr[i])
                return 0;
        }
        return 1;
    }
